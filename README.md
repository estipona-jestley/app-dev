### Attack on Titan <3
Based on google: "Attack on Titan" (Japanese: "Shingeki no Kyojin") is a popular Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It was serialized in Kodansha's monthly manga magazine "Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine" from September 2009 to April 2021. The series has also been adapted into an anime, produced by Wit Studio (seasons 1-3) and MAPPA (season 4), which has further boosted its global popularity.

My thoughts: I really love how Isayama wrote the story from the end up to the start. He really made an effort to make this masterpiece. This is my first ever anime that I watched and will be my best of all time. You can't change my mind. hahah
